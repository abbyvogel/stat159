In this directory, you will find the files `eda-scripts.R`, `regression-script.R`, `test-that.R`, `regression-functions.R`, `session-info-script.R` and `test-regression.R`.

`eda-script.R` contains the R code to generate the summary statistics of TV and Sales and export them to `eda-output.txt`. Additionally, this file generates histograms of both TV and Sales and exports them to .png and .pdf in the images directory.

`regression-script.R` contains the R code that runs a linear model on the data and exports the resulting coefficients and information to `regression-script.R`. Additionally, a scatterplot of TV and Sales is created with the regression line as defined by the linear model and exported to .png and .pdf. 

`test-that.R` and `test-regression.R` are code to test that the functions in  `regression-functions.R` work correctly on the R data mtcars. 

 `session-info-script.R` contains the version of R and all the packages used.
